This project aims to develop a small example of a safety-critical system. A simple example of a critical system:
A miniaturized nuclear-powered control system for operating buses

The control system was designed and implemented using Ada-Spark. The system is inspired by The Big Bus (1976), an American disaster comedy film which follows 
the maiden cross-country trip of an enormous nuclear-powered bus named Cyclops.

This nuclear control system of the bus includes:
  • Activating and Deactivating the Nuclear Reactor. 
  • Managing the control rods of the reactor.
  • Starting and Stopping the bus (managing the speed limit)
  • Management of water supply for cooling the reactor.
  • Management of Nuclear radioactive waste.
  
This project will not go into the detailed technical details of such a system apart from what is common sense and reasonable assumptions about its behaviour. 
The interface is a simple console input/output and it consists of one loop in which the user is asked for suitable parameters and the results calculated by the system are presented.
